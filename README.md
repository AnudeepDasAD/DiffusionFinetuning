# Super Secret Diffusion Model Finetuning Project


Diffusion models have been shown to create images that bare a strong resemblance to copyrighted works, produce artwork that imitates the style of an artist without their permission, or generate images containing nudity. I  developed an approach which can efficiently (in as little as 30s, using 10 prompts) and effectively remove these potentially unwanted concepts of  diffusion models while preserving it's performance on other concepts. 

After the paper is completed and polished, the code will be posted.
